# ATHOS_Fitness-Game
ATHOS: A fitness gamification app
1.	You set fitness goals for yourself
2.	You could also challenge your friends or strangers to these goals
3.	You earn XP by completing these goals and level up your avatar
4.	More XP would also mean more weapons, tools, etc. in your toolkit.
5.	Ultimately, at the end of a month, 
 XP can be converted into discounts or vouchers for fitness gear. 
Example: 
10,000 XP → Discount on Gym Membership (near your homes), so we could like              contact nearby gym owners who could register with the website
20,000 XP → Free Protein Bar/Drink
50,000 XP → Exclusive Merchandise (T-shirt, Shoes, etc.)
6.	Plus, those with most XP, can do stuff like
Higher XP unlocks exclusive battle arenas & leaderboards.
Example:
Basic Arena → Free for all
Pro Arena (1000+ XP) → Only for the top players
Legendary Tournament (5000+ XP) → Compete for the ultimate title
7.	At the beginning, the accountability part will be managed by users later we can add AI to verify the completion of goals.
